        Turn this on if the wallpaper doesn\'t rotate when your home screen is in the landscape mode.
        Usually on the most tables this is not required.
        However, some phone manufactures have official API wrongly implemented, so the fix is required.
        If you don\'t use the wallpaper in the landscape mode, ignore this option.
